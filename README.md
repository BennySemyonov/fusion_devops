# fusion_devops

hi the task completed as requested :)
i assumed from the text "Output should be the following rows" that i need to output only those rows and not the rows that have only 1 object inCollective noun.

to run it you can docker build and run from git, no changes needed. just build and call it as u want and run it without any args.

or you can pull from here and run it: 
docker pull benny1semyonov/fusion_devops
(docker hub)

thanks!
benny :)
